The Integration Hub is the core engine for this mission. It directly facilitates the move to a clean, open, and secure-by-design architecture, enables the decommissioning of legacy data centres by being cloud-native, and provides the essential mechanism for data to flow into the National Data Resource (NDR) where services are unable to integrate directly (the preferred approach).</p> </li> <li> <p>Mission 2: Deliver high quality digital products and services.
